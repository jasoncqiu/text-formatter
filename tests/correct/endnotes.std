   Endnote1[1] Endnote2[2]  Endnote3[3] Endnote4[4] This line  should be
unaffected by  the commands in the  endnotes, and be subject  to default
settings.
[1] This is  an endnote with  default settings. This sentence  should be
    preceded by [1].
[2] This is an endnote with a  textheight command setting it to 1, which
    should have no effect and thus no new page is created.
              [3] This is an endnote with  parindent 10, so it should be
    indented by 14 and should be preceded by [3].
          [4]  This one is the same  as the one above except with indent
0, so it should be indented by 10 and by 0 in subsequent lines.
